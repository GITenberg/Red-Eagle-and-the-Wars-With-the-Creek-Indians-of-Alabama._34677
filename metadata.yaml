description: William "Red Eagle" Weatherford was a Creek (Muscogee) Native American
  who led the Creek War offensive against the United States. Like many of the high-ranking
  members of the Creek nation, he was a mixture of Scottish and Creek Indian. His
  "war name" was Hopnicafutsahia, or "Truth Teller," and was commonly referred to
  as Lamochattee, or "Red Eagle," by other Creeks. During the Creek Civil War, in
  February 1813, Weatherford reportedly made a strange prophecy that called for the
  extermination of English settlers on lands formerly held by Native Americans. He
  used his "vision" to gather support from various Native American tribes.
